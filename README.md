# autograd

Autograd is a forward and reverse mode Automatic Differentiation. Autograd also supports optimization. Automatic differentiation is particularly important in the field of machine learning. For example, it allows one to implement backpropagation in a neural network without a manually-computed derivative

## Running 

First compile the code.

```bash
$ g++ -o out main.cpp
```

Then run

```bash
